               This project recreates a social media experience similar to Instagram, enabling users to connect, share,
               and interact with a dynamic photo-sharing platform. Key features include user registration, photo
               uploading, and profile customization, alongside a chat system for real-time messaging. Users can follow
               and subscribe to each other, and a notification system keeps them updated on interactions, new posts, and
               messages.
